    This program is a competitive application designed for multiple users within an interface. Each participant competes to be the first to extract the most valuable item from an inventory. The program utilizes an automated "click-drag-release" algorithm, which searches and locates images on the screen, moves the mouse accurately, and presses buttons quickly and efficiently to drag the precious item into their possession.

    By using multiple threads, the application optimizes the search and extraction process, creating a fast-paced and intense experience.
